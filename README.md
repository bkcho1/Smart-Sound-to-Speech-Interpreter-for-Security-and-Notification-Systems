# Smart-Sound-to-Speech-Interpreter-for-Security-and-Notification-Systems

## Description
This project involves creating a smart interpreter system that converts specific sounds from devices like security alarms or mobile notifications into meaningful spoken words or sentences. For example, a 'beep' sound from a backyard motion sensor could be translated to a voice saying, "Someone is in your backyard." Similarly, different sounds from various sensors or notifications will be converted into distinct verbal messages. The system will be particularly beneficial for people with disabilities, including those who are blind, providing them with an accessible way to understand and respond to different alerts and notifications.

## Student Learning Goals
- Gain proficiency in developing embedded systems and software applications.
- Understand and implement sound recognition and processing techniques.
- Develop skills in database management for storing sound patterns and corresponding verbal messages.
- Enhance problem-solving skills in creating accessible technology solutions.

## Deliverables
- A fully functioning application that records, interprets and converts specific sounds into predefined spoken words or sentences.
- A database that maps sound patterns to their corresponding verbal messages.
- Documentation detailing the design, development process, and user guide.

## Desired Background
- Knowledge of software development, particularly in programming languages suited for app development (Python).
- Understanding of embedded systems, especially in relation to sound processing and sensor integration.
- Basic skills in database design and management.
- Familiarity with accessibility considerations in technology design, particularly for auditory information processing.

## Usage
- Run the main script using `python sound_recognition.py`
- Follow the on-screen instructions to record and interpret sounds.
